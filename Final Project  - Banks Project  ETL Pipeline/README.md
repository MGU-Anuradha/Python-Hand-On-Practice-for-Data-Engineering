# ETL Pipeline for Largest Banks by Market Capitalization

This project implements an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline using Python to process data about the largest banks in the world by market capitalization. The data is extracted from a Wikipedia archive page, transformed using live exchange rates, and loaded into both a CSV file and a SQLite database. SQL queries are then executed on the final dataset.
